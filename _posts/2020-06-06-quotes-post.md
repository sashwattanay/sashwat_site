* My realization during my 2018 Indo-US round trip:  
*"Money is not everything, but it's almost everything."*

* Found a flaw with the famous quote by Billy Grahm and fixed it:  
*"When character is lost, nothing is lost; when health is lost, something is lost; when wealth is lost, all is lost."*

* Used Einstein's axiom of relativity to moral science to arrive at the Great Axiom of Moral Science  
*"Nothing is wrong, nothing is right; we do what we feel like doing and that is life!"*

* Found a flaw with a famous abridged quote from the Bible and fixed it:  
*"Treat others how you want to be treated, unless you are masochistic or suicidal."*

* *"Life is too short to learn from one's own mistakes only; learn from others' mistakes too."*

* A prelude to my [YouTube tutorial video](https://youtu.be/-fsQ5yuSVNk) on keyboard shortcuts:  
*"Life is too short to count on mouse only; use keyboard shortcuts too."*

* This quote which is inspired from one of the quotes from the movie [The Imitation Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imitation_Game), describes my disdain for birthdays.  
*"Even a broken clock reads the correct time twice a day; even a loser gets to celebrate once a year."*

* *"Never underestimate your foe. After having conquered continents, Alexander was brought down by a mosquito* (allegedly)." 

* Now, let's get political...  
*"People deserve their leader."*

* *"Would you say that a hypnotized person still possesses free will? Would you say that a 'democratic' country with a brainwashed population still lives in a democracy?"*

* What are protests?  
*"A protest carried out while toeing the line set by the authorities is not a protest at all."*

* Inspired by the famous quote by Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose:  
*"There is only one price of freedom: blood! It has always been that way."*

* I would go for democracy any day because it is fair.  
*"I love democracy for it does not give you what is the best but rather what you deserve."*

Let's conclude  with the quote by Shaheed Bhagat Singh which the entire world is in dire need right now  
*“Merciless criticism and independent thinking are the two necessary traits of revolutionary thinking.”*
